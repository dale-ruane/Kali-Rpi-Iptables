Kali-Rpi-Iptables
=================
This is a recompiled version of Kali Linux for the Raspberry Pi including IPTables. 

I recently realised that the arm version of Kali linux, specifically for the Raspberry Pi, was lacking IPTables.

I decided to set about adding IPTables into the kernel and then providing an image that would include IPTables by default.
